\title{Parse KEGG KGML files to extract relations and edges data frames.}
\usage{
parse_kgml_relations(file)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to the KGML XML file.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{from}{The ID of the source entry (node) in the pathway, corresponding to the `entry1` attribute in the KGML `<relation>` tag.}
  \item{to}{The ID of the target entry (node) in the pathway, corresponding to the `entry2` attribute in the KGML `<relation>` tag.}
  \item{type}{The general type of relationship between the two entries (e.g., `"ECrel"`, `"PPrel"`, `"GErel"`, `"PCrel"`, `"maplink"`). These types describe the biological nature of the connection, such as enzyme-enzyme relation or protein-protein interaction.}
  \item{subtype}{A more specific subtype of the relation, derived from the `<subtype>` child elements of the `<relation>` node (e.g., `"activation"`, `"inhibition"`, `"expression"`, `"compound"`). If no subtype is defined, this will be `NA`.}
  \item{rel_value}{A categorical value associated with the subtype, which encodes the apearence of the arrow (from the `value` attribute of `<subtype>`). If not present, this will be `NA`.}
}
}
\description{
Parse KEGG KGML files to extract relations and edges data frames.
}
\details{
The function reads a KEGG KGML (KEGG Markup Language) file, which encodes pathway
information as XML, and extracts all `<relation>` elements that describe the
interactions or relationships between entities in the pathway. Each `<relation>` may
contain one or more `<subtype>` elements that provide additional details about
the interaction. The result is a tidy tibble suitable for network analysis or
visualization, where each row represents one relation–subtype pair.
