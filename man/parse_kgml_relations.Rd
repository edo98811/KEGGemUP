\title{Parse KEGG KGML files to extract relations and edges data frames.}
\usage{
parse_kgml_relations(file)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to the KGML XML file.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{from}{The ID of the source entry (node) in the pathway, corresponding to the \code{entry1} attribute in the KGML \verb{<relation>} tag.}
\item{to}{The ID of the target entry (node) in the pathway, corresponding to the \code{entry2} attribute in the KGML \verb{<relation>} tag.}
\item{type}{The general type of relationship between the two entries (e.g., \code{"ECrel"}, \code{"PPrel"}, \code{"GErel"}, \code{"PCrel"}, \code{"maplink"}). These types describe the biological nature of the connection, such as enzyme-enzyme relation or protein-protein interaction.}
\item{subtype}{A more specific subtype of the relation, derived from the \verb{<subtype>} child elements of the \verb{<relation>} node (e.g., \code{"activation"}, \code{"inhibition"}, \code{"expression"}, \code{"compound"}). If no subtype is defined, this will be \code{NA}.}
\item{rel_value}{A categorical value associated with the subtype, which encodes the apearence of the arrow (from the \code{value} attribute of \verb{<subtype>}). If not present, this will be \code{NA}.}
}
}
\description{
Parse KEGG KGML files to extract relations and edges data frames.
}
\details{
The function reads a KEGG KGML (KEGG Markup Language) file, which encodes pathway
information as XML, and extracts all \verb{<relation>} elements that describe the
interactions or relationships between entities in the pathway. Each \verb{<relation>} may
contain one or more \verb{<subtype>} elements that provide additional details about
the interaction. The result is a tidy data.frame suitable for network analysis or
visualization, where each row represents one relation–subtype pair.
