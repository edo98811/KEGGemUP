\title{Parse KEGG KGML files to extract nodes data frame.}
\usage{
parse_kgml_entries(file)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to the KGML XML file.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{id}{Unique identifier of the entry within the KGML pathway (from the `id` attribute).}
  \item{kegg_name}{The KEGG-specific name or identifier of the entity (from the `name` attribute). This may include one or more KEGG identifiers such as gene IDs, compound IDs, or enzyme EC numbers. Preceded by organism ID}
  \item{type}{Type of the node (from the `type` attribute), indicating the biological entity class such as `"gene"`, `"enzyme"`, `"compound"`, `"map"`, `"ortholog"`, or `"group"`.}
  \item{link}{URL linking to the KEGG resource for this entry, if available (from the `link` attribute).}
  \item{reaction}{Associated reaction ID(s), if any (from the `reaction` attribute). Typically present for enzyme entries.}
  \item{graphics_name}{Display name for the entry, taken from the `name` attribute of the `<graphics>` node.}
  \item{label}{Text label for visualization purposes.}
  \item{fgcolor}{Foreground color of the graphical element (from the `fgcolor` attribute of `<graphics>`).}
  \item{bgcolor}{Background color of the graphical element (from the `bgcolor` attribute of `<graphics>`).}
  \item{graphics_type}{Shape or representation type of the graphical element (from the `type` attribute of `<graphics>`), such as `"rectangle"`, `"circle"`, or `"line"`.}
  \item{x}{X-coordinate of the node’s position in the pathway diagram (from the `x` attribute of `<graphics>`).}
  \item{y}{Y-coordinate of the node’s position in the pathway diagram (from the `y` attribute of `<graphics>`).}
  \item{width}{Width of the graphical element (from the `width` attribute of `<graphics>`).}
  \item{height}{Height of the graphical element (from the `height` attribute of `<graphics>`).}
}
}
\description{
Parse KEGG KGML files to extract nodes data frame.
}
\details{
The function parses a KEGG KGML (KEGG Markup Language) XML file and extracts all
`<entry>` elements, each representing a biological entity in a KEGG pathway diagram.
Each node may contain nested `<graphics>` elements defining visual properties
(such as position, size, and colors) and `<component>` elements that define group
membership for composite entities.

The resulting tibble provides a tidy, one-row-per-entry representation suitable
for integration with relational data models or network visualization frameworks
(e.g., `igraph`or `visNetwork`).
